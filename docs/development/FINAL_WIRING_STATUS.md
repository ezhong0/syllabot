# SyllaBot - Final Wiring Status Report

## ✅ **ALL FEATURES NOW PROPERLY WIRED**

**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Status**: **100% Operational** 🎉

---

## 🔧 **FIXES APPLIED**

### Fix #1: Added `riskScore` Field to All Students ✅
**Problem**: Components expected `student.aiInsight.riskScore` but data only had `confidence`

**Solution**: Added `riskScore` field (0-10 scale) to all 4 students:

| Student | Pattern | Risk Score | Risk Level |
|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| Jake Martinez | Silent Struggle | **7** | High |
| Sarah Chen | Perfectionist Frustration | **7** | High |
| Miguel Rodriguez | Language Barrier | **5** | Medium |
| Emma Johnson | Normal Behavior | **1** | Low |

**Files Modified**: `/src/data/demo-emails.ts` (lines 110, 261, 373, 491)

---

### Fix #2: Added `successRate` Field to All Intervention Projections ✅
**Problem**: Components expected `projectedOutcomes.withoutIntervention.successRate` but data only had `probability`

**Solution**: Added `successRate` field to all students:

| Student | Without Intervention | With Intervention | Improvement |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Jake | 32% | 78% | **+46%** |
| Sarah | 55% | 85% | **+30%** |
| Miguel | 45% | 82% | **+37%** |
| Emma | 95% | 98% | **+3%** |

**Files Modified**: `/src/data/demo-emails.ts` (lines 155, 162, 291, 298, 403, 410, 527, 534)

---

### Fix #3: Fixed Field Name in Components ✅
**Problem**: Components were using `projections` instead of `projectedOutcomes`

**Solution**: Updated all components to use correct field name:
- ✅ UnreadTab.tsx (line 115, 118, 121)
- ✅ StudentDetailView.tsx (line 98-110)
