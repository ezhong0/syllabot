**AI-Powered Teacher Communication Assistant for Early Student Intervention**

![SyllaBot Interface](img/01-inbox-sorted.png)

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Teachers managing 150+ students face an impossible challenge: **detecting subtle behavioral changes that signal a student is struggling**. A brief email that seems routine could be a cry for help—but how would a teacher know if they don't remember that student's typical communication style?

Traditional email clients sort by time. They treat all messages equally. A struggling student's brief "When is the test?" gets buried below routine questions—**unless you have superhuman memory to recall that Jake usually writes thoughtful 45-word emails, and this 4-word message represents an 80% deviation from his baseline.**

**SyllaBot gives teachers that superhuman memory.**

---

## 💡 The Solution

SyllaBot is an AI-powered email assistant that automatically:

1. **Analyzes every student email** against that student's personal communication baseline
2. **Detects pattern changes** that indicate emotional distress, disengagement, or academic struggle
3. **Calculates risk scores** (1-10) based on multiple behavioral signals
4. **Sorts your inbox by urgency**, not chronology—high-risk students rise to the top
5. **Generates personalized draft responses** tailored to each student's specific pattern

### The Magic: Personalized Baselines

SyllaBot doesn't flag emails as "high risk" based on generic rules. It learns each student's normal behavior:

- **Jake Martinez** (baseline: 45 words) → sends 4-word email → 🚨 **High Risk (8/10)**
- **Emma Johnson** (baseline: 12 words) → sends 8-word email → ✅ **Low Risk (1/10)**

Same brevity. Different meaning. SyllaBot knows the difference.

## 🎥 Visual Walkthrough

### 1. AI-Sorted Inbox

![Inbox sorted by AI risk](img/01-inbox-sorted.png)

Your inbox automatically sorts by AI-calculated risk score:
- 🔴 **High Risk (7-10)** - Immediate attention needed
- 🟡 **Medium Risk (4-6)** - Monitor closely
- 🟢 **Low Risk (1-3)** - Normal behavior

Each email shows predicted outcomes:
- ⚠️ **Without intervention: 68%** (dropout/failure risk)
- ✅ **With intervention: 78%** (success rate)

### 2. Compose & Test Emails

![Compose test email](img/02-compose-email.png)

Teachers can compose test emails and watch SyllaBot analyze them in real-time. Select from pre-built templates representing common student patterns:

- **Brief Question (High Risk)** - Very short email, classic disengagement
- **Last-Minute Extension (High Risk)** - Anxious, minimal detail
- **Anxious Perfectionist (Medium Risk)** - Over-explaining, anxiety markers
- **Engaged Student (Low Risk)** - Clear, proactive, well-written

### 3. Real-Time AI Analysis

![AI analyzing email](img/03-ai-analysis.png)

When you hit "Send & Analyze", watch the AI orchestration in action:

- 🧠 **Claude** analyzing patterns & sentiment
- 📊 **Slate** calculating risk score
- 📝 **s2.dev** logging analysis event
- 🌐 **Lingo** detecting language
- ⚡ **Cactus** optimizing for mobile

All working together in seconds to provide actionable insights.

### 4. Detailed Email Analysis

![Email detail view](img/09-email-detail.png)

Click any email to see the full AI breakdown:

**Communication Pattern Analysis:**
- Current email: 4 words
- Student baseline: 45 words
- Deviation: **-91%** (significantly briefer than usual)

**Warning Signals:**
- 🚨 Message became unusually brief
- Current: 9 words vs typical 45-word thoughtful messages
- **-80% deviation**

**Recommended Response:**
- ✅ **Warm Check-In** - Answer the question, but use it as an opening to show you notice and care

### 5. Student Overview

![Students page](img/06-students-page.png)

View all students organized by risk level with behavioral pattern summaries:

**High Risk Students:**

### 7. Action Items

![Dashboard action items](img/08-action-items.png)

Never miss urgent tasks:

- 🔴 **HIGH** - 3 high-risk students need response today
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Response rate below target (85%)

### 8. Communication Patterns

Understand when and how your students reach out:

- **Peak Email Times:** 6-9 PM (42% of emails)
- **Busiest Day:** Tuesday (23% of emails)
- **Common Topics:** Grades (28%), Deadlines (19%)
- **Avg Email Length:** 127 words

### 9. Impact Metrics

See the real-world effect of AI-guided interventions:

### 10. AI-Generated Draft Responses

![AI draft response](img/11-draft-response.png)

Click "Generate Response" to get a personalized draft that:

- ✅ **Answers the question** (test is Friday, covering Civil War unit)
- ✅ **Acknowledges the pattern** ("You've been quieter than usual")
- ✅ **Shows you care** ("I've missed hearing your perspective")
- ✅ **Removes barriers** (available during lunch, office hours, or just to chat)
- ✅ **Maintains warmth** (supportive tone, reassures student they're valued)

**Draft is ready to send** - or customize as needed. Saves 10+ minutes per high-risk response.

## 🧠 How It Works

### Step 1: Email Arrives
Student sends email → SyllaBot captures content, timestamp, sender

### Step 2: Baseline Comparison
- Retrieves student's historical communication data
- Calculates average email length, tone, topics, timing
- Compares current email to baseline

### Step 3: Multi-Signal Analysis

Claude AI analyzes:
- **Communication patterns** (length deviation, tone shift)
- **Behavioral signals** (attendance changes, grade trends)
- **Temporal patterns** (email frequency changes)
- **Sentiment analysis** (anxiety, frustration, confusion)

### Step 4: Risk Scoring

Slate calculates risk score (1-10) based on:
- Communication deviation weight: 30%
- Attendance pattern weight: 25%
- Grade trajectory weight: 25%
- Sentiment analysis weight: 20%

### Step 5: Inbox Prioritization

Emails automatically sort by risk score. High-risk students appear first, regardless of when they emailed.

### Step 6: Response Generation

When teacher clicks "Generate Response":
1. Claude analyzes student's pattern and emotional state
2. Generates warm, personalized response addressing root issue
3. Lingo prepares translations for parent communication if needed
4. s2.dev logs intervention for impact tracking

## 🌟 The Vision

**SyllaBot isn't replacing teachers. It's giving them superhuman pattern recognition.**

With 150 students, it's impossible to remember that:
- Jake usually writes thoughtful 45-word emails
- Sarah's anxiety manifests in over-explanation
- Miguel's brevity is a language barrier, not disengagement
- Emma's short emails are perfectly normal for her

**SyllaBot remembers. So teachers can focus on what they do best: caring for students.**
