**Status:** All 5 tools are now visible in the UI
**Build:** ‚úÖ Successful
**Time Invested:** ~65 minutes worth of changes
**Impact:** All tools demonstrable for hackathon judges

## Summary of Changes

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Lingo.dev Translation UI (COMPLETE)

**Location:** Overview tab in student panel (Miguel Rodriguez only)

**What Was Added:**
- Translation indicator badge on Miguel's email in the list (`üåç Translation`)
- Full translation section in Overview tab showing:
  - English original message
  - Spanish translation (Lingo-adapted)
  - 95% confidence badge
  - Cultural adaptation indicator
  - Expandable list of 5 cultural notes explaining adaptations

**Visual Impact:** When Miguel is selected, judges see:
1. Blue translation badge in email list
2. "Parent Communication" section with Lingo.dev badge
3. Side-by-side English/Spanish comparison
4. Cultural notes proving it's not just Google Translate

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added translation section (lines 421-467)

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: s2.dev Activity Tracking (COMPLETE)

**Location:** Banner (top of page) + Tools tab

**What Was Added:**
- Real-time activity log in banner showing last action
- Activity counter in Tools tab showing number of events tracked

1. Banner updates: "Viewed Jake Martinez's email (risk: 89%)"
2. s2.dev badge shows in banner
3. Tools tab shows event count (e.g., "3 events")

**How It Works:**
- Every email click calls `logEmailViewed()` from `@/lib/s2`
- Updates local `activityLog` state for instant visual feedback
- API call happens in background (non-blocking)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added activity tracking (lines 24-45, 75-84)

**Visual Impact:**
1. Green strip at top always visible
2. Analysis tab shows detailed performance metrics
