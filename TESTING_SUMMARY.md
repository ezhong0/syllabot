# Testing Infrastructure Summary

**Created:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All tests passing

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixed

### Issue
Runtime error: `STUDENTS.get is not a function`
- **Location:** `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx:32`
- **Cause:** `STUDENTS` is exported as `Record<string, StudentProfile>` (plain object), not a `Map`
- **Impact:** Dashboard wouldn't load - critical bug

### Fix
Changed all instances of `STUDENTS.get(id)` to `STUDENTS[id]`:
- Line 22: Sorting logic
- Line 32: Selected student lookup
- Line 95: Email list rendering

**Result:** Dashboard now loads perfectly ✅
