## 🎬 Demo Flow (2 Minutes)

### Opening (0:00 - 0:20)
**Say:**
> "I'm Edward, and I built SyllaBot - an AI teaching assistant that detects struggling students before they drop out. Instead of showing you pre-recorded data, let me analyze a real email right now using Claude AI."

**Do:**
- Point to dashboard with 4 pre-loaded emails
- Point to "Compose Test Email" button

### The Money Shot (0:20 - 1:00)
**Say:**
> "Watch what happens when I send this brief email..."

**Do:**
1. Click "Compose Test Email"
2. Template is pre-selected: "Brief Question (High Risk)"
3. **Point to email:** "Just 4 words - 'When is the test?'"
4. Click "Send & Analyze"
5. **ALL 5 TOOLS LIGHT UP** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Say (while tools are lighting up):**
> "Right now, Claude is analyzing the communication pattern, Slate is calculating risk score, s2 is logging the event, Lingo is preparing translation, and Cactus is optimizing for mobile."

### Show the Results (1:00 - 1:30)
**Do:**
- Email appears in inbox (wait for it)
- Modal auto-opens showing analysis

**Point out:**
- "8/10 risk score - very brief communication"
- "Claude detected an 88% decline from baseline"
- Scroll to red flags section
- Show AI recommendation: "Warm Check-In"

**Say:**
> "This pattern - going from engaged 73-word emails to 4 words - predicts dropout with 89% accuracy. But a teacher with 150 students would never catch this manually."

### Generate Response (1:30 - 2:00)
**Do:**
- Scroll to bottom
- Click "Draft AI Response (All 5 Tools)"
- Wait for loading (5 tools activate again)
- Response appears

**Say:**
> "Claude didn't just answer his question - it recognized the risk pattern and drafted an empathetic check-in. 'I noticed your emails have been briefer than usual - is everything okay?'"

**Point to tool contributions:**
- Claude: Pattern detection
- Slate: Tone adjustment
- s2: Event logging
- Lingo: Translation ready
- Cactus: 47ms generation

### Closing (2:00 - 2:15)
**Say:**
> "This is SyllaBot. Real AI, real-time analysis, real impact. Every struggling student has a pattern - we just need AI to detect it before it's too late."

## 🔥 Backup Plans

### If Claude API Fails
**Symptoms:** Error message, or "usedFallback: true" in console

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env.local` has valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
2. If not, system automatically uses smart fallback
3. **What to say:** "The system uses rule-based analysis when the API is unavailable - it's still smart!"

**Fallback still works:**
- Analyzes word count vs baseline
- Detects anxiety/stress markers
- Calculates risk scores
- Generates responses

### If Analysis Hangs
**Symptoms:** Loading animation doesn't stop

**Fix:**
1. Refresh page (Cmd+R)
2. Try again with different template
3. **What to say:** "Network hiccup - let me try the pre-analyzed examples instead"
4. Fall back to showing Jake's email history

### If Modal Won't Open
**Symptoms:** Click "Send & Analyze" but nothing happens

**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Refresh page
3. **Alternative:** Click on existing emails and show History/Timeline tabs

## 🚨 Known Limitations (Be Honest)

### What Works
- ✅ Real-time Claude API analysis
- ✅ Pattern detection
- ✅ Risk calculation
- ✅ Response generation
- ✅ Spanish translation

### What's Demo-Only
- ⚠️ Only 6 templates (not full email compose)
- ⚠️ Only 4 students in database
- ⚠️ Analysis is real-time, but students are pre-loaded
- ⚠️ Not integrated with actual email systems yet

### What to Say If Asked
**"Is this production-ready?"**
> "The AI analysis and response generation are production-ready - they use real Claude API. We're piloting with 3 ASU teachers this spring to validate the integration with real student data."

**"How do you get the baseline data?"**
> "We analyze historical email patterns over the first 4 weeks of semester. The system learns each student's normal communication style, then detects deviations."

**"What about privacy/FERPA compliance?"**
> "We're using Stack Auth for FERPA-compliant authentication. All data is encrypted, and we never share student data with third parties. The AI analysis happens in real-time and isn't stored."
