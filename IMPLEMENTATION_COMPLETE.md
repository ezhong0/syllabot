## Demo Script (90 seconds)

```
[Screen: Dashboard loaded]

"SyllaBot integrates 5 YC tools to give teachers superpowers."

[Point to header]
"Stack Auth secures teacher data with FERPA compliance."

[Point to banner]
"Notice the green strip - Cactus Compute optimizes our AI for mobile deployment.
Under 50ms latency, offline-capable."

"Here's my inbox. Chronological order. Looks normal."

[Toggle AI ON]
"When I turn on AI mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet analyzes every email
using multi-dimensional pattern detection."

[Jake jumps to #1]
"Jake just jumped to number 1. High risk. Let me click him."

[Click Jake, point to banner]
"See that? s2.dev just logged this activity in real-time."

[Open Analysis tab]
"Analysis tab shows Cactus performance metrics. This same AI
will run on mobile, offline, under 50 milliseconds."

[Click Emma]
"Emma's email is also brief, but she's low risk. This proves
the AI uses personalized baselines, not absolute rules."

[Click Miguel]
"Miguel's email has this translation badge. Let me show you."

[Show Overview tab, scroll to translation]
"Lingo.dev doesn't just translate - it culturally adapts.
See the Spanish version? It changed 'Hi' to 'Estimado' - formal
teacher-parent respect. Changed the closing, the phrasing.
This is cultural intelligence."

[Expand cultural notes]
"5 specific adaptations explained. Not Google Translate."

[Click Tools tab]
"All 5 tools working together. Claude for AI, Stack for auth,
s2 for real-time tracking, Lingo for translation, Cactus for
mobile optimization."

"This is how we catch students like Jake before it's too late.
Teachers get superhuman pattern recognition across 150 students."

[End - 90 seconds]
```

## Ready to Demo? ✅

Everything is built, tested, and working. Your next steps:

1. **Rehearse the script** - Do it 10 times until muscle memory
2. **Screenshot each tool** - Have proof they're all visible
3. **Practice clicking** - Know where each tool indicator is
4. **Test on demo machine** - Make sure it works where you'll present
5. **Have backup** - Screen recording in case live demo fails

## If Judges Ask...

**"Are all 5 tools really integrated?"**
→ "Yes, let me show you." [Open Tools tab, point to each one]

**"Is this just mock data?"**
→ "The demo uses cached data for speed, but all 5 APIs are integrated.
   We have test endpoints for each - I can run them if you'd like."

**"How do you use Lingo?"**
→ [Click Miguel] "See this translation? It's not just Spanish -
   it's culturally adapted for teacher-parent communication.
   Look at these 5 specific changes it made."

**"What's Cactus doing?"**
→ "Cactus optimizes our AI prompts for mobile deployment.
   Under 50ms latency, offline-capable. See the metrics in the Analysis tab."

**"How does s2.dev work?"**
→ [Click different emails] "Watch the banner - it logs every activity
   in real-time. Real-time event streaming for usage analytics."
