# AI-Powered Email Composition System Design
**For SyllaBot - VIBE25-4 Hackathon Demo**

---

## Current State ‚úÖ

**What You Have:**
- ‚úÖ ComposeEmailModal with template selector
- ‚úÖ Real-time Claude API analysis endpoint (`/api/analyze-email`)
- ‚úÖ Risk scoring (1-10)
- ‚úÖ Sentiment analysis
- ‚úÖ Recommended approach detection
- ‚úÖ Pre-built email templates
- ‚úÖ Live analysis overlay showing all 5 tools working

**What's Working:**
1. User selects template ‚Üí Composes email ‚Üí Clicks "Send & Analyze"
2. Claude analyzes the email in real-time
3. Returns: sentiment, risk score, communication pattern, red flags
4. Email appears in inbox as "Live" demo email

---

## Vision: Two-Way AI Composition System

### The Big Idea

**Instead of just analyzing INCOMING emails, also help teachers COMPOSE outgoing emails with AI assistance.**

**Flow:**
```
Teacher sees high-risk student (Jake)
‚Üí Clicks "Compose Response"
‚Üí AI generates 3 draft responses based on student context
‚Üí Teacher picks one / edits it
‚Üí AI re-analyzes and provides feedback WHILE editing
‚Üí Teacher sends with confidence
```

---

## System Architecture

### Phase 1: Draft Response Generation (Core Feature)

**When:** Teacher clicks a student's recommended response

**What Happens:**
1. System reads student's full profile (baseline, red flags, AI insight)
2. Calls Claude API to generate 3 response options:
   - **Quick Answer** - Brief, answers question directly
   - **Warm Check-In** - Supportive, shows teacher noticed patterns
   - **Intervention** - Direct, offers specific help

3. Each draft includes:
   - Subject line
   - Email body
   - **Tone badge** (Professional, Empathetic, Direct)
   - **Predicted student response** (Will they engage? Risk of shutdown?)
   - **Why this works** (Evidence-based reasoning)

**UI Location:** New button in student panel: "Generate AI Response"

---

### Phase 2: Real-Time Composition Assistant

**When:** Teacher is typing in compose modal

**What Happens:**
1. **As-you-type analysis** (debounced, every 2 seconds):
   - Word count vs baseline indicator
   - Tone detector (empathetic, professional, cold, warm)
   - Risk prediction: "This might feel too formal for Jake"

2. **AI Suggestions Panel** (right side of compose modal):
   - ‚úÖ Tone is warm and supportive
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider mentioning his recent absences
   - üí° Suggestion: Add "I've noticed..." to show awareness
   - üî¥ Warning: Email is very brief - Jake needs more support

3. **One-Click Improvements:**
   - "Make this warmer" button
   - "Add context about pattern" button
   - "Simplify language (for Miguel)" button
   - "Translate to Spanish (Lingo)" button

---

### Phase 3: Full AI-Assisted Workflow

**Complete Teacher Journey:**

```
[Inbox] Jake's brief email (8/10 risk)
   ‚Üì
[Click Jake] See analysis: "Silent Struggle" pattern
   ‚Üì
[Click "Draft Response"] AI generates 3 options
   ‚Üì
[Select "Warm Check-In"] Pre-filled composition modal opens
   ‚Üì
[Edit draft] Real-time AI feedback as you type
   ‚Üì
[Review] AI shows predicted outcome:
   - 78% chance positive response
   - Window: 24-48 hours
   ‚Üì
[Send] Email sent, logged to s2.dev, tracked
```

## Detailed Component Design

### Component 1: AI Response Generator

**Location:** Student detail panel, below "Recommended Response"

**UI:**
```tsx

  </div>

  <Button
    onClick={() => generateResponses(student)}
    className="w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-blue-600"

---

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create Draft Generation API

```typescript
// /api/generate-response/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { student, incomingEmail, context } = await request.json();

  const prompt = `Generate 3 response drafts for teacher responding to student...

  Student: ${student.name}
  Risk: ${context.riskScore}/10
  Pattern: ${context.pattern}
  Baseline: ${student.baseline.avgWordCount} words avg

  Incoming email: "${incomingEmail?.body || 'N/A'}"

  Generate JSON with 3 drafts varying in approach:
  1. Warm Check-In (empathetic, shows awareness)
  2. Quick Answer (efficient, professional)
  3. Direct Intervention (concerned, explicit)

  For each draft, include:
  - approach, tone, subject, body
  - predictedEngagement (0-100%)
  - reasoning
  - estimatedRiskReduction`;

  const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219',
    max_tokens: 2000,
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
  });

  return NextResponse.json(JSON.parse(response.content[0].text));
}
```

### Step 2: Add UI to Student Panel

```typescript
// In dashboard/page.tsx - student detail panel

const [draftResponses, setDraftResponses] = useState<Draft[]>([]);
const [isGenerating, setIsGenerating] = useState(false);

const generateDrafts = async () => {
  setIsGenerating(true);
  const res = await fetch('/api/generate-response', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      student: selectedStudent,
      incomingEmail: selectedEmail,
      context: {
        riskScore: selectedStudent.aiInsight.confidence,
        pattern: selectedStudent.aiInsight.pattern,
        redFlags: selectedStudent.redFlags
      }
    })
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  setDraftResponses(data.drafts);
  setIsGenerating(false);
};
```

### Step 3: Update Compose Modal

```typescript
// Add prop to ComposeEmailModal
interface ComposeEmailModalProps {
  // ... existing props
  preFillDraft?: {
    subject: string;
    body: string;
  };
}

// In component
useEffect(() => {
  if (preFillDraft) {
    setSubject(preFillDraft.subject);
    setBody(preFillDraft.body);
  }
}, [preFillDraft]);
```

## Success Metrics

### Judge Experience

**Before (Current):**
- Judge sees: "You can analyze incoming emails"
- Judge thinks: "Okay, sentiment analysis. Seen that before."

**After (With AI Composition):**
- Judge sees: "AI generates response drafts with predicted outcomes"
- Judge thinks: "Whoa, this is actually helping teachers RESPOND, not just analyze. That's useful!"

### Scoring Impact

| Category | Before | After | Gain |
|----------|--------|-------|------|
| **Applicability** | 4/5 | 5/5 | Teachers actually use composition help |
| **Creativity** | 4/5 | 5/5 | Two-way AI (in + out) is novel |
| **Technical** | 5/5 | 5/5 | Already excellent |

**Key Differentiator:** Most demos show AI analyzing data. Few show AI helping humans CREATE better responses.

---

## Why This Matters

### The Real Teacher Problem

Teachers don't just need to KNOW Jake is struggling.
They need to know HOW TO HELP.

**Current tools:** "Jake is at risk."
**Your tool:** "Here are 3 evidence-based responses. This one has 78% success rate."

That's the difference between a dashboard and a tool teachers will pay for.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Build draft generation API** (30 min)
2. **Add "Generate Response" button** (15 min)
3. **Create draft response cards** (20 min)
4. **Connect to compose modal** (10 min)
5. **Test full flow** (10 min)
6. **Rehearse demo** (15 min)

**Total:** 90 minutes to transform demo from "analysis tool" to "AI teaching assistant"

---

**Status: DESIGN READY**

This system showcases all 5 tools working together to help teachers not just understand risk, but ACT on it with confidence.

Build this and judges will see why SyllaBot is fundable. üöÄ
