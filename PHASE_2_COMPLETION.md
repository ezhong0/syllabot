## Technical Highlights

### Slate Integration (Tool #5)

**Components Used:**
1. `getRiskScoreBadge()` - Risk badge color coding
2. `getTimelineColor()` - Timeline bar colors
3. `ConfidenceIndicator` - Progress bar component

**Total Slate-Generated Code:** ~240 lines

### State Management

```typescript
const [aiToggle, setAiToggle] = useState(false);
const [selectedEmail, setSelectedEmail] = useState<DemoEmail | null>(DEMO_INBOX[1]);
```

- AI toggle controls sorting (chronological vs risk-based)
- Auto-select Jake's email (index 1) on load
- Click any email to update selected student panel

### Sorting Algorithm

```typescript
const sortedEmails = aiToggle
  ? [...DEMO_INBOX].sort((a, b) => {
      const studentA = STUDENTS.get(a.studentId);
      const studentB = STUDENTS.get(b.studentId);
      const riskA = studentA?.aiInsight.confidence || 0;
      const riskB = studentB?.aiInsight.confidence || 0;
      return riskB - riskA; // Higher risk first
    })
  : [...DEMO_INBOX].sort((a, b) =>
      new Date(b.timestamp).getTime() - new Date(a.timestamp).getTime()
    );
```

**Result:**
- **AI OFF:** Sarah, Jake, Emma, Miguel (chronological)
- **AI ON:** Jake, Sarah, Miguel, Emma (risk-sorted)
